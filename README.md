Duckfoot is a low profile Corne-inspired split keyboard, powered with Nice!Nano. With a pair of EVQWGD001 roller encoders.

## PCB

Kicab files made with ergogen.

The board is reversible, so one minimal order on PCBWay or JLCPCB gives you 2.5 keyboard and a seconde chance if you suck at soldering.

## Plate and case

Soon.

## ZMK Config example
